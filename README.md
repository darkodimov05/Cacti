# Cacti
Network Monitoring Tool Cacti.

Monitor network traffic with Cacti.
This Project is in GNS3 software.

Cacti is an open source network graphing application that uses RRDTool â€“ a data logging and graphing system for time series data.
A router, by default, connects two different networks, and therefore it should have at least two distinct network interfaces. 

I will import two virtual machines in GNS3, UBUNTU 14.04 and Windows 7 which are in different networks. On Ubuntu 14.04 you must install 
Apache Web Server and then install and configure Cacti. On Windows7 I set up SNMP community. In the picture https://github.com/darkodimov05/Cacti/blob/master/screenshot.png we can see the whole implementation and what is configured on every device.
